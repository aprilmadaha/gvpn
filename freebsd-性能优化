# NETISR: by default, FreeBSD uses a single thread to process all network
# traffic in accordance with the strong ordering requirements found in some
# protocols, such as TCP. In order to increase potential packet processing
# concurrency, net.isr.maxthreads can be define as "-1" which will
# automatically enable netisr threads equal to the number of CPU cores in the
# machine. Now, all CPU cores can be used for packet processing and the system
# will not be limited to a single thread running on a single CPU core.
#
# The Intel igb(4) driver with queues autoconfigured (hw.igb.num_queues="0")
# and msix enabled (hw.igb.enable_msix=1) will create the maximum number of
# queues limited by the Intel igb hardware, msix messages and the number of
# CPUs in the system. Once the igb interface maximum number of queues is
# defined, an interrupt handler is bound to each of those queues on their
# respective seperate CPU cores. The igb driver then creates a separate
# single-threaded taskqueue for each queue and each queue's interrupt handler
# sends work to its associated taskqueue when the interrupt fires. Those
# taskqueues are on the same CPU core where the ethernet packets were received
# and processed by the driver. All IP (and above) processing for that packet
# will be performed on the same CPU the queue interrupt was bound to thus
# gaining CPU affinity for that flow.
#
# A single net.isr workflow on a Core i5 CPU can process ~4Gbit/sec of traffic
# which is adequate for a dual 1Gbit/sec firewall interface. On a system
# supporting mostly non-ordered protocols such as UDP (HTTP/3, Google's QUIC or
# NTPd) you may want to assign more queues and bind them to their own CPU core.
# For a 10GBit/sec interface, we recommend a modern CPU with at least four(4)
# real CPU cores and enable net.isr.maxthreads="-1". Use "netstat -Q" to check
# bindings and work streams. "vmstat -i" for interrupts per network queue.
